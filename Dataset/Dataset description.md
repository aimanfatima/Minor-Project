### The ZIP archive contains a text file with 5 tab-separated columns. The columns in order are:

<ul>
<li>
Meme ID: the ID of the meme assigned by Quickmeme.com. You can download the corresponding meme images by connecting to the URL: http://i.qkme.me/<meme_id>.jpg. For example meme “353npm” corresponds to http://i.qkme.me/353npm.jpg.
</li>
<li>
Data ID: this is an internal Quickmeme ID. It is useful because a larger data ID always means that the meme came after in time, and it can be cast to a number.
</li>
<li>
Total ratings of the meme: the total ratings that the meme had at the moment of the crawl (October 2012).
</li>
<li>
Meme template name: the name of the meme template. Before using it, be sure you make it case insensitive, now it is not (so it distinguish between “Socially Awkward Penguin” and “socially awkward penguin”, in case you are interested in meme misspelling).
</li>
<li>
Week of creation of the meme: the week in which the meme was created, in format “yyyy-[m]m-w”, where w = {1, 2, 3, 4}
